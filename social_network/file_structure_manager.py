"""
Handles file structure operations for picture records.

Responsibilities:
- Ensures correct folder hierarchy based on user ID and picture tags.
- Automatically creates directories and pointer files as needed.
- Encodes folder nesting from tags, using the first tag as the first subfolder, and so on.
- If tags are missing, the picture is placed directly in the userâ€™s folder.

Folder Logic:
- Parent folder: Named after `user_id`.
- Nested subfolders: Created from `tags` (if present).
- Pointer file: Created with a filename based on the record's database `id`.

This module is future-proofed for eventual integration with actual image file handling.
